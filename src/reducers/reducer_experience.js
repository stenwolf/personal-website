My main responsibility is working on the infrastructure side. Some of the projects I worked on are Push Notification, Marketing Offer, and currently Tag Management Solution. Though I mostly work on the back end side, I\'m still pursuing my passion by learning NodeJS, MongoDB, React and Redux on my own time. On my down time, I developed an internal website for Impact Assessment(IA) tool. Currently our whole team is using this tool to keep track of all changes for every production release. Now other teams within Wells Fargo is also reaching out to us as they want to implement their own version of IA tool for their group. I was using NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose and Jquery to create this IA tool.'

      body: 'Bank Of The West (BOTW) is the first job where I started to have real experience with being a web developer. I was hired as one of the two automation developers. When we joined, BOTW just started to have its own IT team, everything prior was outsourced. So we had a chance to implementing everything from scratch. We developed a generic Selenium with TestNG framework which is still being in used for most applications of BOTW currently. When the framework became mature, I moved on to develop an internal website for reporting. This was when I found my passion for web development. I learned about JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 along with animation, Jquery doing this project. Backend server for this report was powered by Java Servlet and Tomcat, along with SQL database. This report website was integrated with the automation framework we created, it automatically tracked all test cases, display screenshots, and send out emails.'

Our automation team was running the regression test suite against the online banking mobile app. QTP at the same was only working on Internet Explorer, so we had to utilize Selenium within QTP as well for other browsers. I was creating the bridge to connect QTP with Selenium using C#, and for some time, I was the sole Selenium developer to create the business components. These components are used by the automation testers within our team. They are easily used by dragging and dropping in Quality Center to create an automated test case.'

Here I was working in the internal development team, doing unit and smoke test, for the Quoting and Small Group Renewal applications. We were using Selenium RC, and later switched to Selenium WebDriver using Java with Junit to automate our smoke test suite. For performance, within the group, we used Jmeter. Our Selenium test framework was also integrated with another SQL framework I created just to make calls to the database to test for data integrity. I was also attending the agile training and learned the Scrum process.'
